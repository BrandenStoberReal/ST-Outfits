### Adding Outfit Information to Prompts

Add a prompt like this into your Character Description or Author's Notes or World Info Entry (depending on how you prefer to prompt AI) to let AI see the current outfit. (*Personally I prefer to add this as Character Notes as System Role and Depth 1. If you inject this at top of the context, each time you change your outfit, AI will have to process whole context. If you are using Api models, you don't have to worry about it, but if you are using local models, you may want to use this trick to keep context cache intact.*)

```
**<BOT>'s Current Outfit**
**Headwear:** {{getglobalvar::<BOT>_headwear}}
**Topwear:** {{getglobalvar::<BOT>_topwear}}
**Top Underwear:** {{getglobalvar::<BOT>_topunderwear}}
**Bottomwear:** {{getglobalvar::<BOT>_bottomwear}}
**Bottom Underwear:** {{getglobalvar::<BOT>_bottomunderwear}}
**Footwear:** {{getglobalvar::<BOT>_footwear}}
**Foot Underwear:** {{getglobalvar::<BOT>_footunderwear}}

**{{user}}'s Current Outfit**
**Headwear:** {{getglobalvar::User_headwear}}
**Topwear:** {{getglobalvar::User_topwear}}
**Top Underwear:** {{getglobalvar::User_topunderwear}}
**Bottomwear:** {{getglobalvar::User_bottomwear}}
**Bottom Underwear:** {{getglobalvar::User_bottomunderwear}}
**Footwear:** {{getglobalvar::User_footwear}}
**Foot Underwear:** {{getglobalvar::User_footunderwear}}
```

*Note: This prompt doesn't include accessory slots. If you want to use accessory slots as well, please add them using the variables I've shared below.*

ðŸ’¡ **Keep in mind, you don't have to use every variable or slot exists.** For example if you don't care what kind of underwear or socks you or your character wears, you can just use "Headwear", "Topwear", "Bottomwear" and "Footwear" to keep things simple. You can make your outfit prompt as complex or simple as you want. You should only use the slots you want to use. However AI can only see the things you show it in the prompt. The prompt piece I shared above is just a guideline. You can get creative and use the variables this system creates however you find useful and personalize your outfit prompt as you like.

If you want system messages to appear after changing clothes, enable system messages option under "Extensions -> Outfit Tracker Settings". There are also settings to automatically open windows when you start SillyTavern if you don't want to use commands every time.

If you want to remove a clothing, enter "remove" or "None" as clothing name.

**Clothing**
- This page has Headwear, Topwear, TopUnderwear, Bottomwear, BottomUnderwear, Footwear and FootUnderwear slots.
- This is the main outfit page.

**Accessories**
- This page has head-accessory, ears-accessory, eyes-accessory, mouth-accessory, neck-accessory, body-accessory, arms-accessory, hands-accessory, waist-accessory, bottom-accessory, legs-accessory and foot-accessory slots.
- You can use these for things like glasses on "eyes-accessory" or backpack on "body-accessory".
- You can also use these for bondage such as "blindfold" on "eyes-accessory" or "black cuffs (chained together)" on "hands-accessory" etc.

**Outfits**
- Here you can *Save Current Outfit*, *Wear a Saved Outfit* or *Delete a Saved Outfit*

## Auto Outfit Updates
<img width="766" height="789" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/322f485e-75bf-494c-ae71-f5201d16c1b0" />

Auto Outfit Updates is an optional feature that you can enable from Extension Settings.

When enabled, after every character response, system will perform a check and automatically wear, remove or change item slots based on what happened in last messages.

Keep in mind that the results of this feature completely depends on how smart the AI you are using is. If you are using an old, small, less smart model, AI may make mistakes and wear/remove things when it shouldn't.

Also since it performs a check after every message, you should have a decent generation speed if you don't want to wait too much between messages.

ðŸ’¡ **Make sure you wait for the check to finish before you say something to AI.**

ðŸ’¡ **AI can wear/remove/change multiple items in one turn.**

ðŸ’¡ **In Extension Settings window you can see the prompt system uses for performing self-check. If you don't know what you are doing, please don't change this.**

## Import Outfit from Character Card

The `/import-outfit` command is a powerful feature that uses LLM analysis to automatically extract outfit information from your character card. This command will:

1. Analyze character description, personality, scenario, and character notes
2. Identify clothing and accessories mentioned in the text
3. Populate the outfit tracker with these items using appropriate commands
4. Clean up the original character card by removing clothing references
5. Fix spelling and grammar errors during the cleanup process

This is especially useful when importing characters that already have outfit descriptions in their character card.

## Connection Profile Support

The auto outfit system now supports using different connection profiles for LLM generation. In the settings, you can specify a connection profile (like OpenRouter, Oobabooga, OpenAI, or Claude) that will be used specifically for auto outfit detection. This allows you to use a different model for outfit detection than for your main conversation if desired.

## List of Variables

If you take a look at the example prompt I shared above, you can see that it uses global variables such as `{{getglobalvar::<BOT>_headwear}}`. You can inject any variable stored in outfit slots anywhere you want using that macro. Write `<BOT>` for character's outfit. Write "User" for user outfit. Instead of `<BOT>` you can also write a character's own name such as `{{getglobalvar::Emma_headwear}}`. If you set Emma's headwear as "Red Baseball Hat" then if you write `{{getglobalvar::Emma_headwear}}` to somewhere, it will appear as "Red Baseball Hat". You can simply write `<BOT>` instead of "Emma" and it'll automatically replace `<BOT>` with name of current active character. These variable macros works just like how `{{user}}` or `{{char}}` macros work. Anywhere you can use those macros, you should be able to use the outfit system's macros as well. Just make sure that variable exists, or it will appear blank in the context.

ðŸ’¡ **User's variable names are always same. They always use "User_" regardless of your persona name.**
